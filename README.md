# Spatio-Temporal-Graph-Convolutional-Networks-A-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Traffic-Forecasting


# abstract
- Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
- tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain
- complete convolutional structures.

# introduction
- linear regression perform well on short interval forecast instead of long terms
- this is a data-driven and using spotio-temporal information method.
- fully utilize spatio-information instead of treating it as discrete units
- $$\hat v_{t+1},...,\hat v_{t+H}  = argmax log_{10} P(v_{t+1},...,v_{t+H}|v_{t-M},...,v_{t})$$
- where $$v_t \in R^n$$, n is an observation vector of n road segments at time step t
